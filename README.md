## Spatial Diffusion in Covid-19: Speed of the Epidemic and Lattice representations

# Author: Matteo Bracco

# Contacts: matteo.bracco000@gmail.com

In this project we explore some possible solutions to implement spatial diffusion into SIR type models, testing on the Covid-19 data.
An R Notebook was developed to estimate necessary parameters from Simulations from covid data in Kodiak Island, Alaska.
Simulation where conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, all the code is available in the Code Folder.


# Important
To run the R notebook, you need to download the epidemiology.csv file available at this [link](https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data) and place it in the same folder of the Notebook
